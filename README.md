Mediterranean-College
=====================

Mediterranean College is part of Xinis Educational Group, an institution with 55 years of continual presence in private vocational and higher education in Greece. Founded 35 years ago, Mediterranean College has developed over this time into a dynamic university/college with a diverse student body. It was the first college in Greece (1992) to “franchise” a degree programme from a British State University. Today, in partnership with internationally recognised universities and organisational centres of the UK, Mediterranean College offers a broad portfolio of franchised undergraduate and postgraduate/ professional programmes. Students have the option of registering for programmes that are delivered either on a full-time or part time/ flexible mode which are taught in either the English or Greek language. Upon successful completion of the undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, students are awarded qualifications issued by the co-operating awarding university/college/institution.
